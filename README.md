## API Reference

> /basic-face-detection/solve

This endpoint will call the hackattic URL to solve the problem. Maybe if you are executing the project in localhost you can get a timeout error. If everything is fine you will receive: `{"result":"passed (playground mode)"}`. To remove the playground mode you need to pass false as the second parameter in HackatticService.

> /basic-face-detection/faces

This endpoint will show all the faces in the image provided by Hackattic.
